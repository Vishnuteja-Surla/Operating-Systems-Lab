## Write a C program to implement the Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm.

(i) Take input from the user only once (Process_id, Arrival Time, Burst Time) and apply SJF.

(ii) Your algorithm should work for both scenarios: 
(a) all tasks arrive at the same time (b) tasks may arrive at a different time.

(iii) Compute completion time, turnaround time,  waiting time and response time for each process  for the given input.

(iv) Further compute the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

(v) Print the schedule for the given input.

Note: You can use only integers for process id. Use the min heap data structure (using linked list) to implement SJF Queue.
