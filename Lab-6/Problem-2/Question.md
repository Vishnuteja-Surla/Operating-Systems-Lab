## Write two different programs (Sender and Receiver) in C to demonstrate IPC using shared memory. Process "Sender.c" will write atleast 100 bytes of data to the shared memory and process "Receiver.c" will read from the shared memory and displays it. Then, "Receiver.c" will write atleast 100 bytes of data to the same shared memory and  "Sender.c" will read and displays it.
