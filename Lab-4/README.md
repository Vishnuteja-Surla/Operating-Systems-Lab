# Question-1

## Implement a preemptive priority scheduling approach.

(i) Provide the input as P_id, arrival time (all are arriving at a different time), 
priority of each process, and burst time.

(ii) Show the Completion time, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each process.

(iii) Compute average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

(iv) Print the schedule for the given input.

### Note: You can use only integers for process id. 
Use the array implementation (dynamically using malloc()) for the Queue. 
At the end of the program remove the queue from the memory.  

# Question-2

## Write a C program to implement round-robin scheduling.

(i)Take input from the user as P_id, arrival time, burst Time, and time quantum.

(ii) Show the turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each task.

(iii) Compute average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

(iv) Count the number of context switches 
(excluding the count at the beginning of the first execution process and the end of the last execution process)

(v) Your algorithm should work for both the scenario: 
(a) all tasks arrive at the same time (b) tasks may arrive at a different time
